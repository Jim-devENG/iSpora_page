Manifesto
iSpora is the Global Impact Engine with a bold vision to drive remarkable, lasting transformation across the Global South through diaspora–home collaboration.
We are building a movement, a network, and a platform to inspire, amplify, and unify the efforts of Diasporans and home-based builders working toward the transformation of Global South nations.
From Africa to Latin America, the Caribbean, Asia, the Middle East, and Oceania, we recognize that countless organizations and individuals are already doing meaningful work. However, their efforts remain largely fragmented, limiting scale and collective impact.
We believe transformation accelerates when efforts are coordinated.
Imagine a unified space where:
* Impact-driven initiatives across the Global South are concentrated, visible, and empowered.
* youths and everyday citizens can discover opportunities locally and globally — and be inspired to create new ones for others.
* academic institutions reconnect and collaborate with their alumni in the diaspora.
* established and nascent youth-led organizations making real impact locally can be seen, supported, and scaled.
* diaspora knowledge, experience, and expertise are channeled into development in a meaningful, measurable way.
* Impactful diasporans, leaders, and organizations are spotlighted, supported and celebrated.
This is what we are building.
iSpora is building that ecosystem — a movement, a global network, and a digital platform powering unified action for Global South transformation. 


Community
Prior to the iSpora digital app launch, we are building a formidable community of local youths and diasporans who share our vision and believe in the massive opportunities that iSpora would open up to both the diaspora and home-based youths of the global south.

Partnership & Collaborations
At iSpora, we are building a coalition of Diaspora innovators, global institutions, NGOs, and impact-driven organizations—both local and international—dedicated to reshaping the future of the Global South. Together, we can accelerate meaningful and lasting change.
As a platform rooted in collaboration, iSpora’s mission directly aligns with SDG 17: Partnerships for the Goals.
We believe that bringing diverse impact-driven efforts into a single, interconnected ecosystem will significantly enhance effectiveness, foster strong and productive collaborations, drive transformation across nations, and inspire greater participation from both Diasporans and home-based change-makers.
If you are an impact-driven founder, Diaspora leader, CEO, investor, builder, or stakeholder connected to the Global South—and you share our vision for transformation—we would be delighted to explore collaboration with you.

Our Story
iSpora was founded on the belief that Global South Diasporans possess immense potential to drive real, lasting transformation in their nations—and that this potential can be most effectively harnessed through an ecosystem that enables seamless collaboration with local and international organizations already working for progress.
Our mission is fundamentally aligned with SDG 17: Partnerships for the Goals.
We exist to build bridges between Diaspora communities, institutions, governments, youth-led initiatives, and impact-driven organizations across the Global South.
Our goal is to create an ecosystem that strengthens collaboration between Global South organizations and their Diaspora counterparts—empowering both sides to do more, together.
As the Global Impact Engine, we also foster partnerships among organizations that share a common vision, enabling far-reaching and sustainable impact.
We recognize that countless youth-led initiatives across the Global South are making meaningful change in their communities yet lack the visibility, support, and resources needed to scale. Through the iSpora platform, we aim to spotlight these initiatives, amplify their work, and help them grow.
